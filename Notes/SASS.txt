SASS:

It is a CSS preprocesser. It lets us use features which are not present in CSS.

2 types of extentensions

.scss -> has curly braces
.sass -> uses indentation

Advantages:

 - Variables - has $ prefix
 - Nesting
 - Modules - use underscore before the file name. Scss compiler will then skip the file. Then we can import it in another Sass file. Included using @use<module name>;
 - Functions and Mixins - Write mixins using @mixin and include them in Styles as @include<mixin name>
 - Inheritance - extend scss styles using @extend<style selector>
 - Use of operators to do calculations.
 - We can use if and if else statements with the help of @if @else if written inside mixins and then including the mixin whereever needed and pass arguments to them
